Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. It extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database.

Web scraping is used in a variety of digital businesses that rely on data harvesting. Legitimate use cases include:

- Search engine bots crawling a site, analyzing its content and then ranking it.


- Price comparison sites deploying bots to auto-fetch prices and product descriptions for allied seller websites.

- Market research companies using scrapers to pull data from forums and social media (e.g., for sentiment analysis).


- Web scraping is also used for illegal purposes, including the undercutting of prices and the theft of copyrighted content. An online entity targeted by a scraper can suffer severe financial losses, especially if itâ€™s a business strongly relying on competitive pricing models or deals in content distribution.
